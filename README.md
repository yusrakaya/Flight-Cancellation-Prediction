There are a number of factors that can contribute to a flight cancellation, such as inclement weather, 
mechanical issues, and crew scheduling problems. Data on past flight cancellations and the factors 
that contributed to them can be analyzed using machine learning techniques and data mining 
techniques to identify patterns and make predictions. 
Data mining techniques can be used to analyze historical flight data to predict flight cancellations. 
The data can include information such as flight schedules, weather conditions, aircraft maintenance 
records, and passenger bookings. Algorithms such as decision trees, neural networks, and clustering 
can be used to analyze this data and identify patterns that are associated with flight cancellations. 
The data mining process can be divided into several steps, such as data cleaning, feature selection, 
and model building. Data cleaning involves removing missing or irrelevant data and making sure that 
the data is in a consistent format. Feature selection is the process of identifying the most important 
variables that are associated with flight cancellations. Model building involves training a machine 
learning algorithm using the selected features to predict flight cancellations. 
It is important to note that flight cancellations can be caused by many factors and it is difficult to 
predict them with high accuracy, even with data mining techniques. Additionally, flight cancellations 
can be influenced by real-time events such as major weather events, and it is difficult to predict these 
events in advance.
In this project, I will import a dataset containing flights information for a major U.S. airline, and load 
the dataset into the notebook. Then, I will clean the dataset with Pandas, use Logistic regression 
method, and build a machine-learning model with scikit-learn.



I aimed to use machine learning and data mining techniques to predict flight cancellations. I collected data on various factors that may influence flight cancellations, such as weather conditions, airline, and departure location.Then preprocessed the data and applied various algorithms to train and test models that could predict flight cancellations with a high degree of accuracy.
The results of our analysis showed that certain algorithms, such as Logistic Regression and Random Forest, performed better than others in predicting flight cancellations. I also found that certain factors, such as the airline and departure location, had a stronger impact on flight cancellations than others.
In conclusion, this project demonstrates the potential of machine learning and data mining techniques in predicting flight cancellations.  However, it is important to note that there are many other factors that can influence flight cancellations, and this project only explored a subset of them. Further research is needed to continue to improve the accuracy of flight cancellation predictions and to incorporate additional factors into the analysis.
